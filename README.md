# Minecraft Server

Welcome! This project provides a simple way to run your own Minecraft server using Docker. With a few commands, you and your friends can start playing together easily.

> **Note:** The commands in the Makefile are written for Windows users by default.
> If you are on Linux or macOS, you can comment out the Windows commands and uncomment the Unix versions provided at the bottom of the Makefile.
> This project was originally made with Windows in mind, but you can easily adapt it for Unix systems!

## Requirements

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Docker**: To run the Minecraft server in a container.
  [Get Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
- **Ngrok account**: To expose your server to the internet.
  [Sign up for Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)
- **Ngrok CLI**: To create a public tunnel for your server.
  [Download Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download)

## Available Commands

- `make start` â€“ Start the Minecraft server.
- `make down` â€“ Stop the server.
- `make restart` â€“ Restart the server.
- `make build` â€“ Rebuild the server files.
- `make console` â€“ Access the Minecraft server console.

## Connection Details

To make your server accessible to everyone, we use Ngrok:

**Steps:**
1. Download and log in to Ngrok.
2. Run `ngrok tcp 25565` or use `make deploy` to start the tunnel.
3. Ngrok will provide you with a public address like `tcp://0.tcp.ngrok.io:12345`.

Share this address with your friends so they can join your server!

> You can use a different service instead of Ngrok if you prefer. Feel free to customize this setup as you like ðŸ˜Š

## .env

You can use a `.env` file to set environment variables for your server.
Hereâ€™s an example:

```properties
# .env example
RCON_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
```

Replace your_secure_password with a strong password of your choice.
